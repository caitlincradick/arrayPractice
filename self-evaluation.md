How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- I feel confident with the content in Arrays so far. 
Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- Yes, there is. I want to practice writing out the different Array methods and see if there are any shortcuts. 
- I need to research Booleans more thoroughly.
What questions do you have about Arrays?
- I had a question about the Booleans. In the exercise it said to name 4 Booleans, however they are true/false yes/no elements. I just did true, false, true, false. Is this correct?
